Initial solution. Hoping to get feedback and improve.

file that houses the algorithm is at src/util/Calculator.js


I use

[
{"volume":"734","quantity":10},
{"volume":"1144","quantity":20}
]
instead of
[
{"bagSize":"200g","quantity":10},
{"bagSize":"400g","quantity":20},
]

is to make it easier for me to make the input form to take input from users.

The good solution could be using data structure like binary search tree for this problem.
```

## Install project dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

## Run the app

```
$ npm start
```
